# End of Time Simulator

This is an Unreal Engine End of Time Simulator based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Issac Newton, and Nikola Tesla, using the Physics Engine of Unreal Engine.

This simulator will only alter the direction of gravity when the North Magnetic Pole gets to the Equator in 2061, on the day Sir Issac Newton calculated it according to the Torah written in the third century. It is the version of the Torah the Church admitted it removed all Pagan Beliefs from, so it is a well-known version of the Torah. The one written in the fourth century has Jesus Christ inserted as a person, to make Jesus Bar Abbas out to be the bad man, for defeating the Roman Empire for their use of Money and Taxation. When these notes of Newton became part of the Public Domain, Religious people decided not to teach Kepler, Newton, or Tesla, and instead teach Einstein theories no one has proven in over a century, proving it is not the truth, yet people believe that a Theory is a way of explaining a fact, making a fact a theory that no one can prove; therefore, I cannot include any theories. 

It is a fact that God is all Light without Darkness, and Einstein removed God from his Alternate Universe in an Alternate Reality, which means not ours, and it does not mean these are Alternatives, rather different, or another version. Around 1942, Einstein denounced his theories, and the newspapers reported he found Religion because he said Newton’s God was Gravity and not Centrifugal Forces. 

A simulator must be based on facts, and the facts are that the Unreal Engines Physics simulation is based on the Math of Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, but not Einstein. This means that I am not including Einstein's Physics in this Simulation, because I am not going to alter the way the physics simulation works; I am only going to use known physics that everyone can agree on, and in this case, it comes down to whose math you use. 

This is only based on facts, and this project does not allow theory. There must be proof that these events will play out according to the Torah, or any Bible based on it, and in science.

Einstein removed the Constant for Light in his theory E = MC<sup>2</sup> by removing God, who is all Light without Darkness, Newton said E = MA<sup>2</sup>, derived from F = MA. 

The logic for the Simulator is based on a list of facts.

1. God is all Light without Darkness we know exists inside the Atom; therefore, God is a spectrum of Light we call Cosmic Rays. Torah or Bible.
2. Atoms are made of Light without Darkness inside a shell of Neutrinos, split one for proof. [Trinary Science](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Principles-Of-The-Trinary-Universe/blob/master/misc/the.principles.of.the.trinary.universe.pdf).
3. Light has no acceleration, therefore it is Static, so you cannot use Einstein's theories which made it Dynamic, and he removed God or Atoms. Tesla.
4. God is the Force of Gravity in all of Newton's Math equations, as proof F = MA, where F is the Force of Gravity,  “M” is the Mass of Atoms that are made of Neutrinos with the Light of God inside them, times the Acceleration of the Mass, which is made of Neutrinos, such that the Speed of Light, is the speed of the Dynamic Universe because Light is Static.
5. The Sun is made of Atoms called Mass. The Mass has a Gravitational Constant of 6.66 x 10<sup>−11</sup> N x m<sup>2</sup> / kg<sup>2</sup>. Newton.
6. Our Planet Earth orbits around the Sun at an average rate of 66,666.666 miles per hour based on the Gravitational Constant of 6.66. [This is the Calculator I used]( https://lightwizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/webforms.html#table_4_07).
7. The End of Time began in 2012 when our North Magnetic Pole started to head south to the Equator. This signaled that counts down until the poles reverse, which is only 49 years away, and it is much closer to 37 years as of 2024 when I wrote this.
8. Newton was born on 25 December 1642 under the Julian Calendar; only the Military uses. The Gregorian Calendar changed it to 4 January 1643, and then they removed 10 days, making it the 14 January, my birthday in 1961; [I am](https://lightwizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/references.html#reference_jeffrey_scott_flesher). medically retired from the U.S. Air Force, and the reason I know this.
9. Our North Magnetic Pole will reach the Equator on 14 January 2061. NASA said our Magnetic strength is decaying at a constant rate of around 5% per century; this is why the Calendar was reset 20 centuries ago, and 20 centuries at 5% means that the strength will reach 0 on this day. Kepler, Newton, and NASA.
10. When the North Magnetic pole crosses the Equator, the South pole will reverse heading to the Artic Circle, or 66° 34' what we now call North. This means the North Magnetic Pole is in the Southern Hemisphere, and the South Magnetic Pole is in the Northern Hemisphere. This will not change the physical pole's polarity, which happens in 2103. 
11. When the Magnetic strength hits 0 as it crosses the Equator, or 0°, the Magnetosphere will collapse, venting our Atmosphere into space for 6.66 minutes. [Flesh](https://lightwizzard.com/books/trinary.universe/references.html#reference_jeffrey_scott_flesher).
12. The [Pole Reversal Math] (https://github.com/AM-Tower/End-Time-Simulator/wiki/Pole-Reversal-Math) is the average size of the Sun or 7,926.2109 × [(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub>)/9] = 6.42 ~= 6.66 Minutes.
13. The number 666 from the Torah, Bible, or Newton's Math, is [how far we are from the Galaxy](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Galaxy-Calculator-2).
14. From the time the Magnetic strength begins to weaken, the Magnetosphere takes <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> the size of the Sun’s diameter, or 864,575.9 miles in diameter on average; multiplied by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> and divide that by the Sun's 3 valance rings to get around 2103 years. We take the hex of 66, which is 42, and minus that, from 2103 to get 2061 years; this is from the Torah, but the Science behind the math is real; I call this Trinary Science, but most know it as Newtonian Science. The math is simple, 864,575.9 × [(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub>/<sub>3</sub>] = 2103.6 - 42  =  2061.6 Years. The calendar was changed to make this math work out to 14 January 2061, the date Sirius aligns with the Great Pyramid, and Earth is the closest to the Sun, so it has more power.
15.  In 2103, as the magnetic poles reach their final position, the physical poles will begin changing, but this process takes 66 years.
16. The End of Time has 3 main events. The first was in 2012 when the poles began moving. The second is in 2061 when our Magnetic strength will hit 0, and our North Magnetic pole reaches the equator, reversing the polarity, venting the atmosphere for 6.66 minutes, creating an instant Ice Age that will last thousands of years. The last event is in 2103, when the magnetic poles reach their destination, and the physical poles begin to reverse. The Universe must switch polarity to balance out its path as it travels through space. 

AM-Tower is tasked with saving a group of humans, so they do not go extinct. It is designed to be the eyes of the world, so they can see the climate changes that happen at the End of Time. 

The world’s Militia leaders got together to form these 16 events and items that define what the End of Time will be, according to Science, Kepler, Newton, Tesla, the Torah, and the Bibles based on it. 

This document is about the Open-Source version of AM-Tower. I will make videos that explain how you can create this simulation using Unreal Engine, and there will be a playable version of it, but it is only a single-player game since it costs money to set up a network for multiplayer support. The paid version has network support. 

**This does not contain the Game, only the simulation.**

This means you can run the simulation and see what happens. Whereas the game has a puzzle that must be solved, so you must find clues while getting points for doing things. 

AM-Tower has a Game/Simulator that I will sell on Unreal Engine Marketplace and a few other game outlets.  The cost is the equivalent of one dollar in any country’s denomination so that everyone can afford it. That is $12 a year in monthly payments or a yearly fee of $10. If you cannot afford it, you can get a free license. 

The concept of AM-Tower is to give the user or player, the option to set 6 settings for the character, and 6 settings for the Society. 

Character settings
1. Gender.
2. Team Color.
3. Name.
4. Birth year.
5. IQ.
6. Techno Ability.

Society settings
1. Science & Education are either based on Einstein or Newtonian. 
2. Law.
3. Money. 
4. Religion.
5. Authority Gender (Who is in charge).
6. Construction technique.

The simulation is based only on physics, whereas the game allows you to interact with things. 

The paid version contains paid plugins, so I cannot make the source code Open. 
The open-source project will have all the free stuff that I can give away, all based on a video series on the YouTube channel [AM-Tower]( https://www.youtube.com/@AM-Tower).

Both versions will take the setting into account, but they will not affect the physics of the game; they will only alter the choices the simulation gives you.

The concept of the AM-Tower project is to simulate the End of Time according to the greatest Torah or Bibles based on it, without any Religion, only Science, so there is no Deity God in the Simulation because that is not an option; the players know the rules.

Religion is what the Church says the Torah says, and not what the Torah says. If that sounded confusing, let me explain this. The Torah and all the Bibles based on it; state God is all Light without Darkness. Religion says Light is Good, and Darkness is Evil, whereas Science knows that Atoms are made of Light without Darkness; we call them Cosmic Rays, which exist inside a shell made of Neutrinos; and how God created the Universe, from the Atomic Level. 

Religion teaches a (Deity) God does not physically exist, as if physically changes the existence of God.  There are many Religions, and some teach God is the name of one of many Angels, where God is the Ugliest Angle in Heaven, and the D`Evil or Devil, is the most beautiful. Religion also teaches that God is the Holy Ghost Spirit. 

AM-Tower allows the user or player to pick if they want to allow Religion, but if you believe in Religion, you do not believe God exists, or is only a Spirit, and that is not the same God as the one that does exist inside of Atoms, and everything is made of Atoms. 

If you believe in Einstein, you do not believe in the End of Time, nor do you believe in God. 

Religion does not teach the End of Time that Sir Isaac Newton calculated; they ignore it, and ignore Newton, because he proved Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah in the Fourth Century. 

The concept of the AM-Tower Game/Simulation is to teach people the End of Time according to the Torah or Bible, Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, and then allow them to make up their minds about what they believe, and the settings allow them to make these choices. 

Regardless of what anyone believes, Kepler, Newton, and Tesla believe God is the Force of Gravity in all their equations, and no one can change that fact, nor the fact that God is all Light without Darkness found inside of all the atoms in the Universe.
