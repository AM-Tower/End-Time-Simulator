# End of Time Simulator

This is an Unreal Engine End of Time Simulator based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Issac Newton, Nikola Tesla, the Torah, and Bibles based on it, using the Physics Engine of Unreal Engine.

This simulator will only alter the direction of gravity when the North Magnetic Pole gets to the Equator in 2061, causing a Pole Reversal, when our Magnetic strength hits 0 our Magnetosphere will collapse venting our Atmosphere into space, causing an instant Ice Age that will last for thousands of years, and why they call it the End of Time. 

This will happen on the day Sir Issac Newton calculated it according to the Torah written in the third century. It is the version of the Torah the Church admitted it removed all Pagan Beliefs from, so it is a well-known version of the Torah. The one written in the fourth century has Jesus Christ inserted as a person, to make Jesus Bar Abbas out to be the bad man, for defeating the Roman Empire for their use of Money and Taxation, so the Church could bring back money to control people with. When these notes of Newton became part of the Public Domain around 1900, Religious people decided not to teach Kepler, Newton, or Tesla, and instead teach Einstein's theories, but after a century no one has proven it, proving it is not the truth, yet people believe that a Theory is a way of explaining a fact, making a fact a theory that no one can prove; therefore, I cannot include any theories in an End of Time Simulation written to save the human race from this extinction event. 

It is a fact that the Torah and Bibles based on it define God as all Light without Darkness. We know Einstein removed God from his Alternate Universe in an Alternate Reality, which means not ours, and it does not mean these are Alternatives, rather different, or another version. Around 1942, Einstein denounced his theories, and the newspapers reported he found Religion because he said Newton’s God was Gravity and not Centrifugal Forces, and why we use Newtonian Science. 

A simulator must be based on facts, and the facts are that the Unreal Engines Physics simulation is based on the Math of Kepler, Newton, and Tesla, but not Einstein. This means that I am not including Einstein's Physics in this Simulation, because I am not going to alter the way the physics simulation works; I am only going to use known physics that everyone can agree on, and in this case, it comes down to whose math you use.  The simulation will only alter the direction and force of the Gravity during the End of Time event.

This is only based on facts, and this project does not allow theory, so do not tell me that I got this Science wrong because I will not listen to any theories. If you say you have facts, then show the proof. There must be proof that these events will play out according to the Torah, or any Bible based on it, and in the science of Kepler, Newton, and Tesla.

Einstein removed the Constant for Light in his theory E = MC<sup>2</sup> by removing God, who is all Light without Darkness, Newton said E = MA<sup>2</sup>, derived from F = MA, proving Einstein plagiarized Newton’s math, you can research the thief in the Patent Office. 

The logic for the Simulator is based on a list of facts.

1. God is all Light without Darkness we know exists inside the Atom; therefore, God is a spectrum of Light we call Cosmic Rays. It takes Electricity to make Light, the same type of electrical waveform as our brainwaves, proving God is our Soul. Satan buys and sells Souls by the Kilowatt. Torah or Bibles based on it, and Tesla.
2. Atoms are made of Light without Darkness inside the shell of Neutrinos. Split and Atom as proof.  Light is Everything. Flesher paraphrased Tesla who called it Matter and Antimatter.
3. Light has no acceleration, therefore it is Static, so you cannot use Einstein's theories which made it Dynamic, and he removed God, Light, and Atoms, proving nothing exists, just like the Deity God of Religion. Tesla.
4. God is the Force of Gravity in all of Newton's Math equations, as proof F = MA, where F is the Force of Gravity, “M” is the Mass of Atoms that are made of Neutrinos with the Light of God inside them, times the Acceleration of the Mass of Neutrinos, such that the Speed of Light, is the speed of the Dynamic Universe because Light is Static. Newton.
5. The Sun is made of Atoms called Mass. The Mass has a Gravitational Constant of 6.66 x 10<sup>−11</sup> N x m<sup>2</sup> / kg<sup>2</sup>. Newton.
6. Our Planet Earth orbits around the Sun at an average rate of 66,666.666 miles per hour based on the Gravitational Constant of 6.66.  Searching the internet will approximate this number, to see the math I used go to [https://AM-Tower.com/documents/]( https://AM-Tower.com/documents/).
7. The End of Time began in 2012 just like the Torah or Bibles based on it said. This event is well documented, it is when our North Magnetic Pole started to head south to the Equator. This signaled a countdown until the poles reverse, which is 37 years as of 2024 when I wrote this.
8. Newton was born on 25 December 1642 under the Julian Calendar; only the Military uses. The Gregorian Calendar changed it to 4 January 1643, and then they removed 10 days, making it the 14 January. The Pagans believed in Christ and those who built the Great Pyramid had it aligned with it every year on this date. We know Christ as the Binary Star Sirius. Numbers do not lie, check the position of Sirius on this date, it will be approximately at a Right Ascension (RA): 06h 45m 08.9s, Declination (dec): -16° 42’ 58". The RA is how long it will take for our Magnetosphere to recover, 16 is Hex, so the Hex for 42 is 66, the event happens at 18:32 PST, 6.66 minutes later is 38.66, and 20 minutes after this, the event is over. God’s Math is written in the Heavenly bodies, and it is all telling us the End of Time is going to happen on this day and time. Newton calculated the End of Time in 1666, born in 42, the Hex is real, this is God’s Math. History proves this.
9. Our North Magnetic Pole will reach the Equator on 14 January 2061. NASA said our Magnetic strength is decaying at a constant rate of around 5% per century; this is why the Calendar was reset 20 centuries ago, and 20 centuries at 5% means that the strength will reach 0 on this day. Kepler, Newton, Tesla, and NASA.
10. When the North Magnetic pole crosses the Equator, the South pole will reverse heading to the Artic Circle, or 66° 34' what we now call North. This means the North Magnetic Pole is in the Southern Hemisphere, and the South Magnetic Pole is in the Northern Hemisphere. This will not change the physical pole's polarity, which begins in 2103. 
11. When the Magnetic strength hits 0 as it crosses the Equator, or 0°, the Magnetosphere will collapse, venting our Atmosphere into space for 6.66 minutes. In the 0 dimension of space, there is no dimension for Light to move, so when the Magnetic Strength hits 0, it will collapse our Magnetosphere, the time to regenerate it is based on God’s Math. Magnetic Science proves this. 
12. The [Pole Reversal Math] (https://github.com/AM-Tower/End-Time-Simulator/wiki/Pole-Reversal-Math) is the average size of the Sun or 7,926.2109 × [(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub>)/9] = 6.42 ~= 6.66 Minutes.
13. God’s Math uses the numbers 3, 6, and 9, because there are 3 sets of 3 valance rings, and where all energy comes from, giving you 6, 66, or 666, and the reason they are found in the Torah, Bible, and Newton's Math, this describes our Sun that on average travels at 666,666 MPH, and Earth that on average travels at 66,666 MPH. Tesla.
14. From the time the Magnetic strength begins to weaken, the Magnetosphere takes <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> the size of the Sun’s diameter, or 864,575.9 miles in diameter on average; multiplied by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub> and divide that by the Sun's 3 valance rings to get around 2103 years. We take the hex of 66, which is 42, and minus that, from 2103 to get 2061 years; this is from the Torah, which was a Pagan Belief. The Science behind math is real it is Newtonian Science. The math is simple, 864,575.9 × [(<sup>1</sup>/<sub>137</sub>/<sub>3</sub>] = 2103.6 - 42  =  2061.6 Years. The calendar was changed to make this math work out to 14 January 2061, the date Sirius aligns with the Great Pyramid, and Earth is the closest to the Sun, so it has more power. Newtonian Science.
15.  In 2103, as the magnetic poles reach their final position, the physical poles will begin changing, but this process takes 66 years just to start to notice the change in permanent magnetic. History will prove this in the year 2169.
16. The End of Time has 3 main events. The first was in 2012 when the poles began moving. The second is in 2061 when our Magnetic strength will hit 0, and our North Magnetic pole reaches the equator, reversing the polarity, collapsing the Magnetosphere, and venting the atmosphere for 6.66 minutes, creating an instant Ice Age that will last thousands of years. The last event is in 2103, when the magnetic poles reach their destination, and the physical poles begin to reverse. The Universe must switch polarity to balance out its path as it travels through space. On Earth, this is known as the End of Time, and it will wipe the face of the Earth clean with Glaciers, leaving no archaeology to dig up, humanity and all its damage to Earth, will be gone in the future.

AM-Tower is tasked with saving a group of humans, so they do not go extinct. It is designed to be the eyes of the world, so they can see the climate changes that happen at the End of Time. 

The world’s Militia leaders got together to form a list of 16 events and items that define what the End of Time will be, according to Science, Kepler, Newton, Tesla, the Torah, and the Bibles based on it. 

The Militia are not allowed to use lethal weapons, only Stun Weapons, they work directly with the Military, so they do not require lethal weapons. 

The Game/Simulation is not geared around gun fights, but it is based on Unreal Engine Lyra, so it is capable of AI battles, but depending on your setting, you might not see them. If you are playing multiplayer, you have the option to be the aggressor, no one sees themselves as the enemy as they do AI bots. 

This document is about the Open-Source version of AM-Tower. I will make videos that explain how you can create this simulation using Unreal Engine, and there will be a playable version of it, but it is only a single-player game since it costs money to set up a network for multiplayer support. The paid version has network support and paid plugins, so it cannot be Open-sourced. I try to use only Free Plugins, but I will use what I need to make a better Game. The Simulator and Game are two parts of the system, whereas the Simulator is Unreal Engine, the Game is what I make of it. 

The concept of this repository is to give users or players the same base setup that I am using in the Game, so they test the simulation for themselves, to ensure that I am not cheating. GitHub Users can Fork this project, and as a community, we can create a Free Game, that does not use Paid Plugins, because those are not Free. 

This is a GitHub Repository, this is Open-Source, the License I use is Unlicensed, and this is the easiest to adopt for Commercial Use. 

**This repository does not contain the Game, only the simulation.**

This means you can run the simulation and see what happens. The game has a puzzle that must be solved, so you must find clues while getting points for doing things. 

AM-Tower has a Game/Simulator that I will sell on Unreal Engine Marketplace and a few other game outlets.  The cost is the equivalent of one dollar in any country’s denomination so that everyone can afford it. That is $12 a year in monthly payments or a yearly fee of $10. If you cannot afford it, you can get a free license, my goal is to get as many players as possible, and not to make a huge profit off of people, but to make enough to pay for all the stuff I want in my Game. I will work on both this Open-Source project and the Paid project. 

The concept of AM-Tower is to give the user or player the option to set 6 settings for the character, and 6 settings for the Society. 

Character settings:
1. Gender.
2. Team Color (Red is Attack, Blue is Passive, and there are 9 team colors).
3. Name.
4. Birth year (Age limits things you can do).
5. IQ (Higher means harder puzzles to solve).
6. Techno Ability (Higher means you must know how to operate things).

Society settings:
1. Science & Education are either based on Einstein or Newtonian. 
2. Law.
3. Money. 
4. Religion.
5. Authority Gender (Who is in charge).
6. Construction technique (6 models).

The simulation is based only on physics, whereas the game allows you to interact with things, this simulation is about testing 6 models using the physics of the End of Time. 

The open-source project will have all the free stuff that I can give away, all based on a video series on the YouTube channel [https://www.youtube.com/@AM-Tower]( https://www.youtube.com/@AM-Tower).

Both versions will take the setting into account, but they will not affect the physics of the game; they will only alter the choices the simulation gives you.

The concept of the AM-Tower project is to simulate the End of Time according to the greatest Torah or Bibles based on it, without any Religion, only Science, so there is no Deity God in the Simulation because that is not an option; the players know the rules, and the settings allow them to make these choices. 

If you want to play a game, you give people options to pick what they want, but the Simulator cannot be based on that, or it is only simulating what people believe, and not what will happen at the End of Time. If you allow Religion, they will not talk about Newton, because he proved Religion was about teaching a Deity God and his Deity Christ Son named Jesus, telling you that Jesus was a Common name back then, which is a half-truth only Satan would tell, see Jesus is a Name, saying was common back then or in the Torah, is a lie. If you pick Einstein, you have no God, which is the same as picking Religion. 

If you read Kepler, Newton, Tesla, the third-century version of the Torah, or you are intelligent enough to know the truth when you hear it, you will understand the concepts they envisioned.  You will understand that Religion is the reason no one knows about the End of Time.  

Religion is what the Church says the Torah says, and not what the Torah says. If that sounded confusing, let me explain this. The Torah and all the Bibles based on it; state God is all Light without Darkness. Religion says Light is Good, and Darkness is Evil, whereas Science knows that Atoms are made of Light without Darkness; we call them Cosmic Rays, which exist inside a shell made of Neutrinos; and how God created the Universe, from the Atomic Level. 

Religion teaches a Deity God does not physically exist, as if physically changes the existence of God, this is the same as believing God does not exist, you cannot believe in something by believing it does not exist.  There are many Religions, and some teach God is the name of one of many Angels, this is known as Polytheism, where God is the Ugliest Angel in Heaven, and the D`Evil, or Devil, is the most beautiful. Religion also teaches that God is the Holy Ghost Spirit. 


Religion does not teach the End of Time that Sir Isaac Newton calculated; they ignore it, and ignore Newton, because he proved Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah in the Fourth Century. 

Regardless of what anyone believes, Kepler, Newton, and Tesla believe God is the Force of Gravity in all their equations, and no one can change that fact, nor the fact that God is all Light without Darkness found inside of all the atoms in the Universe. 

AM-Tower is about the End of Time that Kepler, Newton, and Tesla wrote about, and I try to keep the list of things to know to only a few, the others are just there to give you more information.
